# Load

To get started with Graphane, follow these steps to load it into your HTML page and install it
locally if needed:

### Load Graphane via CDN (Quick Start)

The easiest way to load Graphane dynamically in your browser is by including the script tag pointing
to the Graphane file hosted on the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.graphery.online/graphane/1.0.0-beta/component/composer.js"></script>
```

This method allows you to immediately start using Graphane without any installation or setup, making
it ideal for quick prototyping or experimentation.

### Install Graphane Locally (For Local Development)

If you're working on a larger project and prefer to manage dependencies locally, you can install Graphane via npm:

```bash
npm i graphane
```

This method integrates Graphane into your local development environment, allowing you to manage it
as part of your project and work offline if necessary.


### Dynamic Execution in the Browser

One of the key advantages of Graphane is that it runs dynamically in the browser. This means you do
not need to deal with heavy compilation or transpilation processes during development. You can make
changes, adaptations, or modifications directly in your code, and they will be reflected immediately
in the browser without requiring additional build steps.
