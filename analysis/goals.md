# **Goals of Graphane AI Assistant**

Enhance the **learning**, **design**, and **construction** process with Graphane.

1. **Describe and Explain**:

- **What it does**: Provides human-readable explanations of Graphane functionalities and
  components (e.g., `g-composer`, directives, helpers).
- **Objective**: Learning.
- **Enhancement**: Could also explain specific data visualization techniques and when to use
  different types of graphs.

2. **Document the Code**:

- **What it does**: Automatically generates docstrings, inline comments, and documentation for
  Graphane code, explaining each step.
- **Objective**: Construction.
- **Enhancement**: Include best practices and templates for documentation, making it customizable
  based on project needs.

3. **Provide Data Examples**:

- **What it does**: Offers sample datasets or allows the user to input a data description,
  generating dummy or real-world data for testing visualizations.
- **Objective**: Design and Construction.
- **Enhancement**: Suggest modifications to the data structure to fit different types of graphs (
  e.g., bar charts, line charts).

4. **Create Graphs from Scratch**:

- **What it does**: Based on user input (e.g., data and description), it generates a complete graph,
  including the Graphane code and any necessary configuration.
- **Objective**: Design and Construction.
- **Enhancement**: Allow the user to specify preferences for the visual elements, such as axis
  labels, titles, or even interactivity.

5. **Suggest Palettes**:

- **What it does**: Recommends color palettes that harmonize well with the graph, considering
  accessibility and contrast ratios.
- **Objective**: Design.
- **Enhancement**: Could also suggest palettes based on specific color theory (e.g., analogous,
  complementary) or brand colors.

6. **Provide Code Snippets**:

- **What it does**: Offers code snippets or full functions based on what the user is trying to
  achieve, either by context or by explicit request.
- **Objective**: Construction.
- **Enhancement**: Could suggest optimized code patterns and offer alternatives for better
  performance or readability.

7. **Identify Errors and Suggest Fixes**:

- **What it does**: Analyzes Graphane code to identify potential errors, bugs, or inefficiencies,
  and suggests fixes.
- **Objective**: Construction.
- **Enhancement**: Offer not only error fixes but also optimizations for performance and
  maintainability.

8. **Visual Customization Suggestions**:

- **What it does**: Based on the type of graph being built, it suggests enhancements such as
  annotations, tooltips, or axis customization.
- **Objective**: Design.
- **Enhancement**: Recommend responsive designs that work across different devices (e.g., mobile vs.
  desktop).

9. **Optimization for Data Handling**:

- **What it does**: Analyzes the data pipeline (e.g., data transformations or filtering) and
  suggests ways to optimize or preprocess data efficiently for Graphane visualizations.
- **Objective**: Construction.
- **Enhancement**: Could suggest using certain JavaScript functions or Graphane helpers for better
  performance.
